The solver takes an input Sudoku board, solves it, and outputs the solution if possible.

2. Either directly running the script(transform a 2D sudoku board to forumula and generate solution with the given functions) or 
Run the provided server script to host the soduku solver. Navigate to the local server to use it to solve your desired sodoku.
